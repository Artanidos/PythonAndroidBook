Are you going to build a GUI app for Android using Python or are you just curious what's possible in your programming language of choice then this book is for you.
This book covers the full process from installing over coding to deploying apps to Android using Python, Qt5, PyQt5 and Visual Studio Code.
This book covers only the declarative approach using QtQuick and QML.
I will show you how to setup a Linux machine as development and deployment platform and an Android phone as deployment device.
All apps described in this book should also work on the other platform like iPhone, Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Who This Book Is For
If you are able to write basic Python code and you are interested in developing apps with user interfaces for Android in Python this book is right for you.
This book does not assume that you are familiar with Qt.
If you want, try out all of the examples in this book it would be a great benefit if you are also working on a Linux machine like me, but MacOS and Windows should also be ok if your are able to search for help in the internet for OS specific differences.

If you already read my book Python GUI - Develop Cross Platform GUI Applications using Python, Qt 
and PyQt5 you might only see that one chapter differences to this book along some other enhancements.
I used a few chapters of that book and I only added one chapter about QML applications and therefore I have dropped the Desktop part.
